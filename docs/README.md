# QfPlus Documentation

[中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This directory contains the project-level documentation for QfPlus. Keep the Chinese and English versions aligned when changing architecture, workflow, or coding rules.

## Document Map

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Runtime layers, backend modules, frontend structure, data flow, and platform boundaries. |
| [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) | Local setup, commands, verification, debugging, and contribution workflow. |
| [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) | Release assets, local Windows build steps, the manual-trigger workflow for macOS/Linux, and checklist. |
| [CODE_STYLE.en.md](CODE_STYLE.en.md) | English coding style, naming rules, comments, file splitting, and review gates. |
| [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md) | Chinese coding style and fine-grained refactor plan. |

## Documentation Rules

- Update both languages for user-facing or contributor-facing changes.
- Keep commands executable from the repository root unless a document explicitly says otherwise.
- Prefer concrete file names over vague module names.
- Keep architecture documents descriptive, and keep code style documents prescriptive.
- Do not document generated files as hand-written source.
